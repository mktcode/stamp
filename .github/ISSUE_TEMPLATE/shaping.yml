        # Checklist

        All these questions should be answered before moving to implementation. We donâ€™t need a scientific thesis, but ensure that you have considered these questions thoroughly.

        - [ ] What is the maximum time we want to spend on this?
        - [ ] Did we do some prototyping or browsing through the code to getting an idea of what expects?
        - [ ] Is the scope clearly defined and aligned with that? What tradeoffs have been made?
        - [ ] Do we have clear success/done criteria and have tests been discussed/drafted?
        - [ ] Have all emerging subtasks been identified and clearly shaped as well?
